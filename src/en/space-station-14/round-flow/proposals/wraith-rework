## Overview

This proposal is a partial redesign of the old wraith from SS13.
The first change is a base kit redesign that revolves around EmoGarbage404's idea to add a fear mechanic.
The wraith can use its abilities to inflict a fear debuff on the crew which generates power
to use stronger abilities or evolve and become more powerful.
The second change addresses survivability in that it is too easy to kill early and too difficult to kill later.

## Background

The wraith is an underwhelming role currently. 
It tends to play passive since it can die very easily early in its lifetime.
It also doesn't have many abilities to cause conflict or add midgame ghost roles for dead players.
The main benefit of these proposed changes is that it will allow the wraith to lean into its strength as
a unique fear based stealth/manipulation role and evolve into something terrifying to the crew.

This redesign is focused on 3 aspects:

a). Implements most of the old wraith abilities/evolutions from SS13 (some features are missing such as diseases).
    The old designs had plenty of skill expression, potential for the wraith to become a major threat
    when left uncontested, and lots of ghost roles.

b). Pulls from EmoGarbage404's idea to focus on gaining power through a fear mechanic. This also borrows 
    some of their ability designs to generate fear and places into the base ability kit.

c). Redesigns the basic functionality of the role for added survivability and to make it more counterable and fun
    to play against or with for the crew.
